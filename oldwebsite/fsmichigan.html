                              <p><strong>FSAE Michigan  May 2011</strong><strong> </strong></p>
                              <p>  </p>
                              <p><img src="fsmichigan_image001.jpg" alt="image003" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_2" align="left" height="80" hspace="12" width="267">FSAE Michigan takes place at the famous Michigan  International Speedway in May. Close to a 100 teams, most of which are from the  US, participate in this competition every year. Since its the oldest of all Formula Student / SAE  challenges, over the years, FSAE Michigan has commanded considerable respect  from all teams. Consequentially, the competition here is cut-throat and there  is barely room for any mistakes.  </p>
                              <p>  </p>
                              <p align="right"><img src="fsmichigan_image002.gif" alt="image001" v:shapes="Picture_x0020_1" height="32" width="32"></p>
                              <p> </p>
                              <p><em>The Build up:</em></p>
                              <p>  </p>
                              <p>We  commenced work on our first car with the hope of participating at FSAE Michigan  2011. Technically and financially, it was an unprecedented challenge. While we had about four years of  experience in building cars (working on the Baja series), we had never actually  built a Formula race car. To raise money for a project of this magnitude with  just CAD models as proof of what we were capable of, was a daunting task. This  initial stage was a trying one requiring the team to carve out it's path. <br>
                                <br>
                                Despite those gruelling times, we treaded ahead steadily and were able to  complete our first Formula race car right on time. In honour of our then Title  Sponsor, we christened the car as <em>C&amp;C Alpha NR-XI</em>. </p>
                              <p>  </p>
                              <p><em>The Event:</em></p>
                              <p>  </p>
                              <p>FSAE  Michigan 2011 saw over a 100 teams participate that year. We were overjoyed to  qualify for the event - the only Indian team that year - and excited about  participating in the competition.  </p>
                              <p>  </p>
                              <p>However,  disaster struck us when our car couldn't make it to the competition. A  logistics error prevented the car's onward journey at the UK, while it was  en-route to USA. Understandably, this was a huge blow to the team - efforts of  an entire year were made void.  </p>
                              <p>  </p>
                              <p>The  competition organizers, fully aware that overseas participants are often  troubled by such problems, allow teams to participate at the static events  (which do not require the car's presence), should such a setback occur. While  much of the team's morale was down, this opportunity was just the buoy needed  to stay afloat. It allowed for a mental victory through those difficulties. We  managed the 60th spot in the Cost Report and 79th in the Business Presentation  event, a notable achievement for a debutant team.  </p>
                              <p>  </p>
                              <p>On  the brighter side, the experience we gained was invaluable. First-hand  experience of competing in the static events was going to be vital for our  preparations for the next year's competition. The logistics fiasco made us more  alert and responsible. Definitely, the experience at FSAE Michigan serves as  the spring board for our future endeavours. We owe a lot to the team of 2011,  who paved the way by building our first car despite numerous hurdles. Their  guidance and expertise is invaluable and helps us take NITK Racing forward.</p>
