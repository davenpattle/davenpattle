    <p>The team had its humble origins in 2007, when it participated at the first ever SAE-India Baja competition. The competition required the teams to build an off-road buggy or ATV (All-Terrain-Vehicle). Since then, NITK Racing has participated in every annual edition of the competition. As the years rolled, the team saw great successes and looked to go international- to the Formula SAE events. It was decided to have two teams work simultaneously on two distinct cars each season. As a result, the Formula Student team of NITK Racing was formed. Now, NITK Racing participates at the Baja competition as Junkyard Maniacs, who have consistently performed well to achieve top spots.</p>
