            <p>FSAE Michigan takes place at the famous Michigan International Speedway in May. Close to a 100 teams, most of which are from the US, participate in this competition every year. Since its the oldest of all Formula Student / SAE challenges, over the years, FSAE Michigan has commanded considerable respect from all teams. Consequentially, the competition here is cut-throat and there is barely room for any mistakes.</p>

            <p>We commenced work on our first car with the hope of participating at FSAE Michigan 2011. Technically and financially, it was an unprecedented challenge. While we had about four years of experience in building cars (working on the Baja series), we had never actually built a Formula race car. To raise money for a project of this magnitude with just CAD models as proof of what we were capable of, was a daunting task. This initial stage was a trying one requiring the team to carve out it's path. Despite those gruelling times, we treaded ahead steadily and were able to complete our first Formula race car right on time. In honour of our then Title Sponsor, we christened the car as C&C Alpha NR-XI.</p>

            <p>FSAE Michigan 2011 saw over a 100 teams participate that year. We were overjoyed to qualify for the event - the only Indian team that year - and excited about participating in the competition. However, disaster struck us when our car couldn't make it to the competition. A logistics error prevented the car's onward journey at the UK, while it was en-route to USA. We managed the 60th spot in the Cost Report and 79th in the Business Presentation event, a notable achievement for a debutant team.On the brighter side, the experience we gained was invaluable.</p>

            <p>In 2011, our logistics troubles continued well after FSAE Michigan, as a result of which the car was brought back in September, a good four months late. This cut short our preparation time for the next season. After much deliberation, we decided to target FS Hungary '12 as it gave us sufficient time to test, analyse and re-engineer our car. All the improvements paved way to the transformation of the C&C Alpha NR-XI to the DH NR-XII.</p>

            <p>In August 2012, NITK Racing participated at Formula Student Hungary (FSH). In its third year now, FSH saw a total of 41 teams, from twelve nations, competing for the top honours. Spread over four days, August 17 - 20, the event managed to attract teams, students, audience and the media in an unprecedented manner. With Audi Hungaria as FSH's main sponsor, there was little doubt that the event would be anything short of perfect. Understandably, the competition was intense and the atmosphere fired up. Some teams had close to eight years of experience to their credit, while others had their budgets running into crores of rupees. European teams have a technological and financial edge when compared to their counterparts from around the world. It was understood that an uphill task lay ahead of us. We realized early that we had come to a competition where the one thing that we could take back, unbeaten, would be the experience of competing with the best teams. The teams, with their diverse backgrounds, varied experiences and disparate credibilities, found the event as an ideal window to interact amongst themselves. It was very encouraging and comforting to be noticed, appreciated and helped by other teams. A shout out for KEFO Motorsport, the team from Kecskemet, Hungary for helping NITK Racing.</p>

            <p>Following our success in FS Hungary, we embarked upon building a new car for our third season. Taking account of all factors including required time to build a new car, time required to sponsor the required components and various other daunting tasks, we decided to participate in SUPRA '14. With our aim in mind to bag a top 10 spot on international level and put our college on the world map and showcase Indian engineering excellence, we introduced myriad of innovations in the new car, ranging from a Carbon Fibre Intake to a Rapid Prototype Exhaust. We also procured brand new body shells for the new car and chose to install a Hand Clutch for better control. With everything planned, prepped and tested thoroughly, we were prepared to participate.</p>

It proved to be strong morale damper for the team, but we decided to put our best foot forward despite the troubles and aimed to perform at our best in the Static events. Our determination and conviction proved fruitful. The design of the new car was well received by the judges and helped us bag the SUPRA Design Innovation Prize.

Yet despite our best efforts, problems with logistics plagued us again, with the car being held at Chinese Customs. We were unable to release the car and had to participate in the events sans car.
